          "## Description",
          "Network segmentation strategies involve dividing a larger network into smaller, isolated segments to enhance performance and security. In the context of eco-friendly smart home solutions, this means creating dedicated sections for different types of devices, such as IoT sensors, smart appliances, and security systems. By implementing segmentation, homeowners can control traffic flow, minimize potential attack surfaces, and improve overall network efficiency.
